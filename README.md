# TrackCovid
App that tracks news about covid in different countries - made in Java. Made as my final project for CS50. 

TrackCovid uses two different online APIs: https://thevirustracker.com/api and https://github.com/NovelCOVID/API for all the information provided. 



For an explanation about how the app functions, check out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKTDRwd3jOc
